# Polyglot Tasks

A collection of self-contained programming tasks and projects,
to serve as a reference and a zoo.
Especially useful for comparing different programming languages.

Most of these serve to illustrate multi-file or even multi-module programs/libraries/etc.,
given that most polyglot code is single-file snippet-style code. This is also a
chance to learn best practices for building and packaging.

## Conventions

Each folder is of the form `{{3-digit number}}-descriptive-task-name`.

Within each folder, each implementation has its own folder of the form
`{{language_name_or_code}}[__style-{{paradigm}}][__using-{{distinguishing library/module}}][__backend-{{bindings_language_name or code}}]`

Yes, this is verbose, but it is also unambiguous, so it is worth it.

So for example, an implementation using OOP Python with C++ bindings via PyBind11 and built with CMake+GCC/Clang would be

`python__style-oop__backend-cpp__bind-pybind11`

whereas a task with a single python implementation would be in a folder named simply

`python`
