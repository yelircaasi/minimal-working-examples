# project-euler-multilingual
In which I practice familiar programming languages and learn new ones by solving problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

The notes on each problem contain detailed explanations of the code. While these problems and solutions are no replacement for good documentation and tutorials, the notes should allow anyone to get a feel for how the languages work and make it easier to jump into coding. After all, that was one of the reasons I decided to tackle the problems in the first place.
