Your task is to write a program that finds a solution in the fewest moves possible single moves to a random Fifteen Puzzle Game.
For this task you will be using the following puzzle:

``` 
15   14   1   6
 9   11   4  12
 0   10   7   3
13    8   5   2
```


Solution:
```
 1    2    3    4
 5    6    7    8
 9   10   11   12
13   14   15    0
```

The output must show the moves' directions, like so: left, left, left, down, right... and so on.
There are two solutions, of fifty-two moves:

```
rrrulddluuuldrurdddrullulurrrddldluurddlulurruldrdrd
rrruldluuldrurdddluulurrrdlddruldluurddlulurruldrrdd
```

Finding either one, or both is an acceptable result.
